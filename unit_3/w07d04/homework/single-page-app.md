# Single-Page Applications HW markdown

1. A single-page application is an app that works with the browser to dynamically rewrite the information of the current page as needed by the client. Instead of loading entire separate pages.
This was a way to make applications seem more dynamic and fluid.

2. A multi-page application is where every time you want to view new information, an entirely new page has to be loaded. Which can slow things down, being not as dynamic.

3. Our unit 2 apps were multi-page apps, because the user is constantly asking retrieving info from the server to then render on the client side.

4. Two pros for an SPA would be a smoother experience for the user being that they never leave the current page, and it has a faster development time.

5. Two cons of an SPA would be a slow initial load, like the twitter example in the wikipedia resource, and memory leaks in JS can lead to a drop in performance or maybe even a crash.

6. Two pros of a MPA would be that they are a simpler option, and that the initial page load is usually much quicker.

7. two cons of an MPA would be that every new page takes equally as long to load as the initial page, and not all the code can be re-used for a mobile version of an app which means more time developing.

# Startup that Saved the Worst Website

1. They served as a crack team which could resolve small issues as they arose. they built an insurance application called App2, which signed up new users in half the time as its predecessor. And they replaced the website's login system with a functional and significantly less expensive one.

2. Application Programming Interface

3. An API is the engine that provides all the functionality that us users rely on. It is the messenger that takes requests from the user with what they want to do, then returns an appropriate response.
