# Datatypes


## Lesson Objectives
- Be able to identify the basic datatypes in JavaScript



### Strings

A string is made up of characters, it is wrapped in quotes or backticks

Here are some examples:

- "Hello, world"
- 'Hello, galaxy'
- \`Hello, universe\`

**GOTCHA** - many word applications (including Slack) convert dumb quotes `""` or `''` into smart quotes `“...”` - JavaScript doesn't recognize smartquotes as valid code

### Numbers

Numbers, in JavaScript can be both integers and floating point numbers (numbers with decimals).

- `1` - integer (whole number)
- `1.1` - floating point number (number with a decimal)
- `Infinity` (must be capital I) and `-Infinity`
- NaN - not a number a value that arises when one attempts mathematical operations on one or more things that are not numbers

### Variables

A variable can be made up of letters, numbers and some characters (like `_` and `$`). It cannot start with a number. It is capable of holding any kind of data.

It is **NOT** wrapped in quotes - this is how JavaScript distinguishes a string (has quotes) versus a variable (no quotes)

It must be declared using `let` or `const`. You can use `var`, but `var` is an older syntax.

```js
  const a = 'the letter a'
  let b2 = 5
  var c3po = 'cool robot'
```
### Booleans & Operators

The values `true` and `false`

Additionally, in the next lesson we'll cover Boolean operators like `||`, `&&`, `===`, `>` etc.

### Null, Undefined

These values mean that the value is not assigned


### Arrays and Objects

Arrays (called lists in other languages) can hold many items  and different types of items - these items can be numbers, strings, variables, and even other arrays!

An array is represented with square brackets `[]` and each item is separated by commas. We'll have an entire lesson dedicated to them!

```js
[1,2,3,4]
```

Objects (sometimes called dictionaries or hashes in other languages) can hold many items, but they have key and value pairs. We'll have an entire lesson dedicated to them!

An object is represented with curly braces `{}` and each key is separated from its value with a `:` and each key value pair is separated by a comma.

```js
{
  school: 'General Assembly',
  class: 'Software Engineering Immersive',
}
```

### typeof

If you need to figure out the type of something you can use `typeof`

Let's try it:

```js
console.log(typeof 1)
console.log(typeof 'hello')
console.log(typeof true)
```
